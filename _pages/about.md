I am a PhD student studying radio astronomy at the University of Sydney. 

Fast Radio Bursts
======
The main research topic of my thesis is using the Australian SKA Pathfinder to detect and analyse Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). I am part of the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) project, led by my co-supervisors Dr. Keith Bannister and Dr. Ryan Shannon.
