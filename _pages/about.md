Hi I'm Harry, I'm the radio spectrum scientist at the SKA Observatory Spectrum Management Group.

Spectrum, Satellites and Space Situation Awareness
======
The SKAO is one of the co-host institutes of the IAU CPS, the centre for protecting the dark skies against satellite constellations. The spectrum management group at SKAO is spearheading the radio work on constellation interference, as satellites are now becoming one of the major active interference sources. I'm applying my radio astronomy experience in RFI excision and fast transient detections to develop tools and analysis methods to help us work with the industry to mitigate these effects.

I'm currently leading the development of [scepter](https://hqiu-nju.github.io/scepter/) for SKA operations to better understand and mitigate the impact of satellite constellations.


Fast Radio Transients
======
The main research topic of my PhD thesis is using the Australian SKA Pathfinder to detect and analyse Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). I am part of the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) project, led by Dr. Keith Bannister and Prof. Ryan Shannon.

Australian? Chinese?
======
I spent my early childhood in Adelaide, South Australia before moving back to Nanjing, China with my parents where I completed high school and my undergraduate education. This somewhat reverse immigrant experience has made me a fluent billingual speaker. I am lucky to call both countries home and I hope to assist in building deeper ties and friendships between the two countries.
