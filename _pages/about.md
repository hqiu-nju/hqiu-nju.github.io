Hi I'm Harry, I'm a postdoctoral research fellow at the SKA Observatory working on radio transients, in particular Fast Radio Bursts.

Fast Radio Bursts
======
The main research topic of my PhD thesis is using the Australian SKA Pathfinder to detect and analyse Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). I am part of the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) project, led by Dr. Keith Bannister and Prof. Ryan Shannon.
