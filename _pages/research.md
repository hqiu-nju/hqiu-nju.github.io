My research focuses on radio transients, specifically Fast Radio Bursts.

# CRAFT-GP: A 10-hour Galactic Plane Single Pulse Survey

# Pulse Profile Analysis of FRBs

# Scatter Broadening in the ASKAP FRB population

I am also interested in X-ray transients, having discovered one X-ray binary during my undergraduate thesis project in Nanjing.
