My research focuses on radio transients, specifically Fast Radio Bursts.

# Pulse Profile Analysis of FRBs

# Scatter Broadening in the ASKAP FRB population

# Others

## X-ray transients in the 3XMM Catalogue
I am also interested in X-ray transients, having discovered one X-ray binary during my undergraduate thesis project in Nanjing. 
You can check the paper on this Symbiotic X-ray Binary [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...847...44Q/abstract)
