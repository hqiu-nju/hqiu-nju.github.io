My research focuses on radio transients, specifically Fast Radio Bursts. I have been lucky enough to be part of the CRAFT project which uses ASKAP to search for Fast Radio Bursts. Our team has made various achievements and discoveries, including the first real-time localisation of a single FRB event.

## Transient search software
At the start of my PhD I conducted a series of FRB injection tests to assess the performance of the CRAFT FRB pipeline. 
The core software of the pipeline is the fast dedispersion trial code FREDDA, an implementation of the FDMT algorithm written in CUDA.
You can check out my thesis for a brief summary of some of the performances by FREDDA.

# CRAFT-GP: A 10-hour Galactic Plane Single Pulse Survey

This is a single pulse search using eight ASKAP antennas as single dishes to provide a rapid 10-hour observation covering the entire southern Galactic plane between b<Â±7 degrees. During this survey, we detected one FRB 180430 in the anti-Galactic-centre direction and a collection of single pulses from several radio pulsars.

The fun part of the observation was utilising the ASKAP Phased Array Feeds to tile the survey and also adjusting the pre axis roll of the dishes of the telescope.
You can see the beautiful "rainbow road" in this figure below.

# Pulse Profile Analysis of FRBs

I developed a pulse fitting program to analyse the dynamic spectrum of dispersed radio pulses.
We've been utilising this code to measure the pulse properties of ASKAP FRBs, confirm the dispersion measure and also dissect possible multi-component structures using Bayesian statistics such as FRB 180924 and FRB 190608 in high time resolution data [(Day et al. 2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497.3335D/abstract).

# Scatter Broadening in the ASKAP FRB population

Further on playing with Bayesian statistics, I use the scatter broadening and other pulse properties to discuss the scattering screen locations and implications of FRBs as probes at extragalactic scales.


## X-ray transients in the 3XMM Catalogue
I am also interested in X-ray transients, I discovered one X-ray binary from my undergraduate thesis work in Nanjing University. 
You can check out this Symbiotic X-ray Binary [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...847...44Q/abstract).
